SBOM Analyzer for Software Applications and Apps
Overview
The SBOM Finder is a Minimally Viable Product (MVP) designed to generate, analyze, and compare Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) for desktop and mobile applications. It supports multiple SBOM formats (CycloneDX, SPDX), enables fuzzy component search, and offers side-by-side SBOM comparisons through a modern web interface powered by Streamlit.

Features
SBOM Generation: Generate CycloneDX JSON SBOMs using Syft.

SBOM Comparison: Highlight added/removed components between two SBOMs.

Fuzzy Component Search: Find components via fuzzy matching.

Platform Detection: Auto-detect desktop (.exe) or mobile (.apk) binaries.

Metadata Extraction: Extract app metadata, permissions, libraries, and smali packages.

Library Inference: Use apktool, aapt, and 7z for Android analysis.

Advanced UI: Interactive Streamlit interface with upload, toggles, and comparison views.

API Integration Ready: Backend modularity for future integration.

Cross-format Support: Supports parsing CycloneDX XML SBOMs.

Docker Support: Containerized deployment for consistent environment setup.

Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

Git

Docker (for containerized deployment)

Optional: Local installation of apktool, aapt, 7z for full APK/EXE analysis.

Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/sx54693/sbom.git
cd sbom
Local Installation
bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
# Activate Virtual Environment
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the App Locally
bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
âœ… Note: For APK analysis, ensure apktool, aapt, and 7z are available in your system path. On Streamlit Cloud, APK features will degrade gracefully with warnings.

Docker Deployment
Build Docker Image
bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t sbom-analyzer .
Run Docker Container
bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -d -p 8501:8501 sbom-analyzer
Access the app at: http://localhost:8501

Usage
Generate SBOM: Upload .exe, .apk, or .json and click "Generate SBOM".

Compare Applications: Upload two files and click "Compare SBOMs".

Search Components: Use fuzzy search to find libraries (e.g., androidx, kotlin).

Deployment Options
Local: Full support via Streamlit.

Streamlit Cloud: Limited APK feature compatibility.

Advanced: Deploy on GCP, AWS EC2, or Docker for complete toolchain support.
